	“…dividing the cow in half does not give you two smaller cows. You may
	end up with a lot of hamburger, but the essential nature of “cow” — a living
	system capable, among other things, of turning grass into milk — then would be
	lost. This is what we mean when we say a system functions as a “whole”. Its
	behavior depends on its entire structure and not just on adding up the behavior
	of its different pieces.” <i style="display: block; float: right">— Kauffman, 1980, p2</i>
